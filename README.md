# Open Journey Planner SDK for iOS

## Overview

This SDK is targeting iOS applications seeking to integrate [Open Journey Planner(OJP) APIs](https://opentdatach.github.io/ojp-ios/documentation/ojp/) to support distributed journey planning according to the European (CEN) Technical Specification entitled “Intelligent transport systems – Public transport – Open API for distributed journey planning”.

Currently the SDK is under construction, so there is not yet a stable version and the APIs may change.

- [Trip Request](https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/cookbook/ojptriprequest/)
- [TripInfo Request](https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/cookbook/ojptripinforequest/)

## Requirements

- Compatible with: iOS 15+ and macOS 14+

## Installation

## Usage

### Initializing

TBA
- endpoints configuration
- requesterReference
- authBearerToken - where to get it from

``` swift
import OJP

let apiConfiguration = APIConfiguration(
    apiEndPoint: URL(string: "your api endpoint")!, 
    requesterReference: "your request reference", 
    additionalHeaders: [
        "Authorization": "Bearer yourBearerToken"
        ]
    )

let ojpSdk = OJP(loadingStrategy: .http(apiConfiguration))
```

### Basic Usage

Get a list of Locations from a keyword.

``` swift
import OJP
        
// get only stops
let stops = try await ojpSdk.requestLocations(from: "Bern", restrictions: .init(type: [.stop]))

        
// get stops and addresses
let stops = try await ojpSdk.requestLocations(from: "Bern", restrictions: .init(type: [.stop, .address]))

```

Get a list of Locations around a place with longitude and latitude

``` swift
import OJP

let nearbyLocations = try await ojpSdk.requestLocations(from: Point(long: 5.6, lat: 2.3))
```
